VB - VCS branching utility
==========================

.. warning:: Nothing works.

You can create as many branches and working copies as you want using
Git, but determining where to checkout branches requires you decision.
It is highly extensible but not handy at the same time.

VB is a command line tool to automate it.  You can:

#. Create a branch and checkout a working copy at predictable place.
#. Remove the working copy after it is merged.
#. Automatically sync indexes.
